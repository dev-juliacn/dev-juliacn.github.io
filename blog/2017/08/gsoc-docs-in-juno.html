<p>The aim of this GSoC project is to provide a convenient way to access documentation in the
Juno IDE. Any work on this has to be on the Julia side (for getting the necessary
information by introspection) <em>and</em> on the Atom side (for presenting said information).</p>

<p>Most of the work on the Julia side went into a new package, <a href="https://github.com/pfitzseb/DocSeeker.jl">DocSeeker.jl</a>,
which implements all of the introspection necessary to get docstrings from installed packages;
a small shim in Atom.jl (<a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/Atom.jl/pull/99">Atom.jl#99</a>) then
delegates any front end requests to that package.</p>

<p>The front end work is directly included in the Juno stack (<a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client/pull/377">atom-julia-client#377</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/pull/148">atom-ink#148</a>, to be precise), since it’s pretty
fundamental IDE functionality.</p>

<h2 id="backend-docseekerjl">Backend: DocSeeker.jl</h2>
<p>The two main challenges here are <em>collecting docstrings</em> and <em>filtering docstrings</em>, both in
the most performant and reliable manner possible.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-information">Collecting Information</h3>
<p>DocSeeker.jl contains a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">alldocs()</code>, which will return information about all
symbols available in the current Julia session. Those symbols are easily found by recursing
through all currently loaded <code class="highlighter-rouge">Module</code>s and calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Base.names()</code> on them. Additionally,
Julia’s docsystem collects all symbols with attached docstrings, which can be easily retrieved.</p>

<p>All of that is pretty slow – it takes on the order of half a second on my machine with a
couple of loaded packages (and returns information about ~13,000 symbols). At the same time
the available symbols don’t change too often, so caching is a viable solution.</p>

<h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3>
<p>There are all sorts of possible options to consider when filtering and searching through the
symbols (and attached docstrings) returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">alldocs</code>, but I’ve decided on a few that
turned out to be most important while testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exported: Julia doesn’t (yet) have a way to make certain symbols part of a module’s
public API, so I’m using the set of exported symbols instead.</li>
  <li>Module: It’s possible to search in a specified module, in all loaded modules or in all
installed modules.</li>
  <li>Search: Either in names only, or in names and docstrings.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point warrants some more information, because it’s not as trivial as the other two
to get at least somewhat right. The basic problem here is a (fuzzy) full text search, which
is what each search engine out there in the depth of the internet tries to do. Naturally
there are quite a few (open source) implementations out there already: solr, lunr (which is
used by <a href="https://docs.julialang.org">docs.julialang.org</a>), but also e.g. the FTS extension
for SQL and many more.</p>

<p>In the early days of the summer I was trying a couple of things to get this to work properly,
but shelling out to Java or JavaScript seemed like overkill for the problem at hand, while
SQL.jl was giving me quite a hard time <em>and</em> doesn’t ship the FTS extension by default.</p>

<p>A custom implementation did not seem too hard at first, but requires a <em>good</em> scoring function
that, given a search query <code class="highlighter-rouge">needle</code>, maps a docstring to a number between 0 and 1:
<script type="math/tex">score: (needle,\\,docstr) \\mapsto [0, 1]</script>
At first I tried rolling my own string comparison function (with mixed success), but then I
stumbled upon the excellent <a href="https://github.com/matthieugomez/StringDistances.jl">StringDistances.jl</a>
which does pretty much all I needed.</p>

<p>The scoring function is applied to all relevant symbols in a threaded loop (which gives a
free 1.5x speedup on my machine); afterwards all applicable filters are applied and the top
20 results are returned.</p>

<p>Filtering and searching takes about 0.1s on my machine, which means that it’s almost negligible
compared to the time necessary for retrieving the docstrings.</p>

<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p>Now that DocSeeker.jl has found the results we asked for, it’s time to display them in an
appealing manner:
<img src="/images/blog/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno/search.png" alt="search" /></p>

<p>If you’ve used Juno before you may notice the much improved markdown rendering (which is of
course available all throughout Juno): There’s syntax highlighting, LaTeX rendering and lots
of general improvements.</p>

<p>Apart from that the docpane UI shows most relevant information (type of the binding, defining
module, whether the binding is exported etc.); a click on the binding will take you to the
defining location and a click on the module will give some information on that. Links also
generally work fine (external ones will open in your default browser, while those defined with
Documenter.jl’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">[link](@ref)</code> syntax will start a new search).</p>

<h2 id="try-it">Try it!</h2>
<p>These features will have been integrated into Juno at the beginning of September 2017, so feel
free to try them!</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I’d like to thank Mike Innes for all the fruitful discussions about implementation and
functionality, as well as his guidance on Julia/Juno development in general (well before
GSoC even started).</p>
